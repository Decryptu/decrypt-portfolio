This responsive component renders customizable keyboard keys suitable for various applications, adapting elegantly to both dark and light modes. Utilize the `KeyboardKey` component in your project by simply setting the `character` prop to display the desired key.

<div

    style={{
        background: 'linear-gradient(100deg, #18181b 50%, #f4f4f5 50%)'
    }}
>
    <KeyboardKey character="⌘"/>
    <KeyboardKey character="⇧" />
    <KeyboardKey character="Space" />
    <KeyboardKey character="K" />
</div>

To incorporate the `KeyboardKey` component into your project, simply import it and pass the `character` prop as illustrated below:

```tsx
import KeyboardKey from "./components/KeyboardKey";

function MyApp() {
  return <KeyboardKey character="⌘"/>;
}
```

## Source Code

Create the `KeyboardKey` component in `@/app/components/KeyboardKey.tsx` following this structure:

const KeyboardKey: React.FC<KeyboardKeyProps> = ({ character }) => {
