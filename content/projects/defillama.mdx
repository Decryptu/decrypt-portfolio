## UI/UX Design for DefiLlama Projects

DefiLlama encompasses a suite of projects including LlamaSwap and LlamaPay, each with unique features and functionalities aimed at enhancing the cryptocurrency user experience. Below are the UI/UX designs I created for these projects.

### LlamaSwap

LlamaSwap is an aggregator of crypto DEXes, helping users find the best prices for their crypto swaps. I designed the UI for the newly added Earn and Borrow tabs. The Earn tab allows users to find the best APY rates for earning, similar to Lido for Ethereum. The Borrow tab helps users find the best borrowing rates, similar to AAVE.

### LlamaPay

LlamaPay is a cryptocurrency payment provider and an alternative to Coinbase Commerce. Unlike traditional payment providers like Stripe, LlamaPay offers unique features such as subscription models that use yield from AAVE to reduce or even eliminate costs. It supports more blockchain networks, offers significantly cheaper gas fees, and has lower overall fees.

I designed the UI for several key components of the LlamaPay platform, including the landing page, dashboard, payment page, and subscription page.

### SmolRefuel Rebranding

As part of the DefiLlama suite, SmolRefuel is a tool designed to simplify the acquisition of gas on the Ethereum blockchain by enabling users to exchange tokens on other blockchains. I undertook the rebranding of SmolRefuel, creating a new logo to establish a stronger brand identity that reflects its innovative approach to solving cross-chain gas issues.

#### Logo Design

The new logo for SmolRefuel captures the core function of the tool, emphasizing its role in seamless and efficient crypto transactions across multiple blockchains.

### LlamaGate UX/UI Design

LlamaGate is a website that allows creators to gate content—such as Discord servers or Substack newsletters—behind a crypto paywall. Users can pay with cryptocurrency either through a one-time payment or a subscription to access the gated content. I was responsible for the UX/UI design of the LlamaGate platform, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience for both content creators and consumers.

#### Product Overview

LlamaGate offers a streamlined interface for setting up and managing content gates, making it easy for creators to monetize their work.

#### Dashboard Design

The LlamaGate dashboard provides creators with a comprehensive view of their gated content, subscriber details, and earnings, all within a user-friendly interface.
