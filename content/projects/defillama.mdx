## UI/UX Design for DefiLlama Projects

DefiLlama encompasses a suite of projects including LlamaSwap and LlamaPay, each with unique features and functionalities aimed at enhancing the cryptocurrency user experience. Below are the UI/UX designs I created for these projects.

### LlamaSwap

LlamaSwap is an aggregator of crypto DEXes, helping users find the best prices for their crypto swaps. I designed the UI for the newly added Earn and Borrow tabs. The Earn tab allows users to find the best APY rates for earning, similar to Lido for Ethereum. The Borrow tab helps users find the best borrowing rates, similar to AAVE.

### LlamaPay

LlamaPay is a cryptocurrency payment provider and an alternative to Coinbase Commerce. Unlike traditional payment providers like Stripe, LlamaPay offers unique features such as subscription models that use yield from AAVE to reduce or even eliminate costs. It supports more blockchain networks, offers significantly cheaper gas fees, and has lower overall fees.

I designed the UI for several key components of the LlamaPay platform, including the landing page, dashboard, payment page, and subscription page.
