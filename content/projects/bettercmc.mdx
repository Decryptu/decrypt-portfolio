# Better CoinMarketCap Extension

Enhance your CoinMarketCap experience with "Better CoinMarketCap," a Chrome extension that simplifies and improves the website's interface by removing ads, community sections filled with scams, and other unnecessary elements. The latest update introduces a "Market Overview" card, replacing the problematic "Community" section with valuable insights into the total market cap, 24h volume, and BTC/ETH dominance.

## Features

- **Clean Interface:** Removes ads and community sections for clutter-free browsing on CoinMarketCap.
- **Market Overview Card:** Offers key market insights including total market cap, 24h volume, and BTC/ETH dominance on the homepage.
- **Market Cap to Volume Ratio:** Displays ratios with color indicators for easy assessment of market cap versus volume, aiding in smarter investment choices.
- **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV):** Shows FDV next to market cap, with color coding for quick valuation insight: green (0-10%), yellow (10-50%), red (>50%). "âˆž" marks infinite supplies.
- **Dynamic Theme Support:** Ensures feature styles adapt to CoinMarketCap's day and night modes.
- **Modern Design:** Provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface.
- **Open Source:** Encourages transparency and community contributions on GitHub.
