## UI/UX Design Portfolio

Explore a variety of UI/UX designs created for cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence sectors. This portfolio includes both original concepts and some experimental design mashups, where elements from different websites are blended together to explore new visual styles.

### Featured Designs

Each image represents a unique approach to enhancing user experience through thoughtful design. Some are entirely original, while others are mashupsâ€”creative experiments combining features from existing websites. These mashups are not commercial but serve as a fun and insightful way to challenge and expand design possibilities.
