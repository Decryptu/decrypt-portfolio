Capybarapp is a comprehensive crypto dashboard designed to visualize the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. It provides valuable insights through a variety of features including a real-time top 100 cryptocurrency list, a crypto heat map, and countdowns to halving events across various coins. The platform was crafted entirely by me, from the UI/UX design to the development, using React and advanced charting tools.

This redesign highlights the shift from an AI focus to a cryptocurrency focus, aligning the functionality with the needs and interests of crypto enthusiasts and traders. The interface is carefully designed to ensure a seamless user experience while providing deep, actionable insights into the crypto market.
