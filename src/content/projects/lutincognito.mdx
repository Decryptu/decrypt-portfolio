## Lutincognito

Lutincognito is a Secret Santa website I designed and developed end to end. The product focus is straightforward: make organizing group gift exchanges feel simple, cozy, and stress-free, with a clear interface and zero bloat.

The app is built with **Next.js** and **Prisma**, with a strong emphasis on smooth flows, visual clarity, and practical features for real groups.

## Core Product Focus

- **Simplicity first**: clean UI, minimal steps, and clear information hierarchy
- **Privacy-first group play**: participant emails can be hidden and nicknames/avatars are prioritized
- **Useful real-world tools**: messaging, wishlist management, and delivery addresses for distant groups
- **Comfortable experience**: polished dark/light mode and a cozy visual direction

## Key Features

- Create and manage Secret Santa draws
- Participant messaging inside each draw
- Wishlists to share gift ideas
- Address management for shipping gifts remotely
- Hidden participant emails to preserve privacy
- Nicknames and avatar personalization
- Email notifications for important draw events
- Full dark/light theme support
