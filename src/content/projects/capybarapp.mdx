CapybarApp outlines the transition from CapybarIA, an ambitious AI dashboard designed to visualize the dynamics of the AI ecosystem, to CapybarApp, a specialized crypto dashboard catering to the needs of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders. This shift was primarily driven by the high costs associated with managing the APIs required for AI data aggregation, prompting a strategic pivot to a more sustainable focus on cryptocurrency.

## CapybarIA: The Original AI Dashboard

CapybarIA was initially developed as a data visualization platform aimed at analyzing the artificial intelligence ecosystem. It featured metrics such as the aggregated market cap of AI companies, rankings of open-source natural language processing engines, trends in developer activity on GitHub, and much more. The platform was developed in React and utilized ECharts for dynamic visualizations.

Despite its innovative approach and detailed analytics, CapybarIA faced challenges related to the sustainability of its data sources and the ongoing costs of API management, leading to its reevaluation.

## CapybarApp: A New Direction in Crypto Dashboard Design

Leveraging the core ideas and design principles from CapybarIA, CapybarApp was created as a comprehensive dashboard focusing entirely on the cryptocurrency market. This platform provides insights through a real-time top 100 cryptocurrency list, a crypto heat map, and countdowns to halving events across various coins. I crafted this platform from scratch, focusing on UI/UX and the overall design using React and advanced charting tools.

## Conclusion

The evolution from CapybarIA to CapybarApp exemplifies how adaptive design and strategic business decisions can lead to the development of more focused and sustainable digital products.
